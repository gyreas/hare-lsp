The overlayfs module provides a [[fs::fs]] implementation that is composed of
two filesystems: the underlay and the overlay. The overlay fs is writeable while
the underlay is read-only. The overlayfs provides a single view.

As an example, let the overlay be rooted at /tmp/overlay. Then,
fs::create(overlayfs, "/path/to/file") will create a file at
/tmp/overlay/path/to/file.

This is currently used as an in memory store for files managed by the client
through textDocument/didOpen, textDocument/didChange and textDocument/didClose
notifications.

This module is an experiment, unsure if it will be kept.
