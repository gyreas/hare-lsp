This module provides an implementation of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
format, as defined by RFC 8259. Note that several other, incompatible
specifications exist. This implementation does not include any extensions; only
features which are strictly required by the spec are implemented.

A lexer for JSON values is provided, which may be initialized with [[lex]] and
provides tokens via [[next]], and which uses a relatively small amount of memory
and provides relatively few guarantees regarding the compliance of the input with
the JSON grammar.

Additionally, the [[value]] type is provided to store any value JSON value, as
well as helpers like [[newobject]], [[get]], and [[set]]. One can load a JSON
value from an input stream into a heap-allocated [[value]] via [[load]], which
enforces all of JSON's grammar constraints and returns an object which must be
freed with [[finish]].
